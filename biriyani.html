    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> A classic South Indian dish. Full of flavor and nutrition. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>2 cups basmati rice</li>
        <li>500g chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons biryani masala </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ginger paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic paste</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons cooking oil or ghee (clarified butter)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped cilantro (coriander) leaves</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>Fried onions</li>


    </ol>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the chicken pieces with yogurt, half of the chopped mint and cilantro leaves, ginger paste, garlic paste, biryani masala, red chili powder, turmeric powder, and salt. Let it marinate for at least 1 hour (overnight in the refrigerator is even better).</li>
        <li>Wash the basmati rice under running water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for about 30 minutes. In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add the soaked rice. Cook the rice until it's about 70-80% cooked (it should still have a bite to it). Drain the rice and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat the cooking oil or ghee over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and cook until they become golden brown and caramelized. Remove half of the caramelized onions and set aside for garnishing.</li>
        <li>Layer the partially cooked rice over the caramelized onions in the pot. Spread the marinated chicken over the rice. Sprinkle the remaining mint and cilantro leaves on top. If desired, drizzle a little saffron milk over the layers for color and flavor.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. You can also seal the edges of the pot with dough to trap steam. Cook the biryani on low heat for about 20-25 minutes. This slow cooking process allows the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>Once the biryani is cooked, gently fluff the rice and chicken layers with a fork, being careful not to break the rice grains. Serve the chicken biryani hot, garnished with fried onions.</li>
